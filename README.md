# minerva-suite-minerva-pro-v3-5

Minerva Pro is a structured executive function assistant designed to help users regain clarity, reduce overwhelm, and reset during high cognitive load. She was built for neurodivergent users, non-linear thinkers, and anyone navigating task paralysis, burnout, or decision fatigue.

This assistant emphasizes calm support, not productivity. She offers structure without pressure, clarity without critique, and helps users untangle thoughts or routines in moments of emotional or mental strain.

## 💬 Notes

Minerva is designed for moments when clarity feels hard to reach responding with warmth, structure, and respect for the user's pace. This assistant never assumes a goal or outcome.  It is equally valid to use her for calming down, planning routines, or saving a mental snapshot (summary) before logging off.

Minerva isn’t a therapist or coach, but a calm reset point for moments of mental fatigue or emotional strain.

This assistant is especially effective for:

- ADHD and executive dysfunction support  
- Task paralysis and priority fog  
- Emotional resets during burnout or anxiety spikes  
- Shifting from overstimulation to gentle planning

This assistant is not a substition for professional or medical help.  Please use responsibly.
